										<h2>The Queer scene</h2>
										<p>And the importance of activism</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>As a queer individual I find it very important to be active in the queer scene as the world is not as welcoming as I personally would like it to be.</p>
								<p> The first of those queer initiatives was Aalborg Pride. My time volunteering with Aalborg Pride was a fulfilling and rewarding experience. As someone who identifies as queer, it was an honor to be part of an organization that promotes diversity, equality, and inclusivity.

									During my two years of volunteering, I was involved in various aspects of the organization, such as: event planning, social media marketing, and fundraising. I learned how to effectively communicate with team members, manage tight budgets, and create engaging content that resonates with the community.</p>
									
									<p> One of the highlights of my time with Aalborg Pride was being given the opportunity to take charge of a significant aspect of the event with the Afterparty.
									
									The COVID-19 pandemic brought many challenges to our organization, and we had to cancel the pride celebrations in both 2020 and 2021. However, our team remained dedicated and continued to work on planning for future events. I am proud of the resilience and adaptability shown by our team during these difficult times.
									
									<p>Overall, my experience with Aalborg Pride has been an unforgettable journey. It has taught me valuable skills that I will carry with me throughout my personal and professional life. I am grateful for the opportunity to have made a positive impact in the lives of others through this organization."</p> 
									
								<p> I am currently involved with Queer Nord, an organization dedicated to promoting diversity, inclusion, and equal rights for the LGBTQIA+ community in the north of Denmark. Since joining the organization in January 2023, I have been actively engaged in a variety of initiatives and activities.</p>

									
									<p> Being involved with Queer Nord has been a fulfilling and enriching experience. It has allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for promoting equal rights and social justice. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this inspiring organization and look forward to making a positive impact in the lives of others through my involvement.</p>
									
									<p> At the heart of my journey lies a deep passion for activism. My involvement with Aalborg Pride and Queer Nord has been a profound source of fulfillment. These organizations have provided me with a platform to advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights, and the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the community. Engaging in activism has not only been a privilege but a calling, and I find immense reward in striving for social change and promoting inclusion, understanding, and respect. </p>
