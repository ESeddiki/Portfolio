										<h2>The Queer scene</h2>
										<p>And why i find it important to be involved</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>As a queer individual i find it very important to be active in the queer scene as the world is not as welcoming as i personally would like it to be.</p>
								<p> The first of those queer initiatives was Aalborg Pride. My time volunteering with Aalborg Pride was a fulfilling and rewarding experience. As someone who identifies as queer, it was an honor to be part of an organization that promotes diversity, equality, and inclusivity.

									During my two years of volunteering, I was involved in various aspects of the organization, including event planning, social media marketing, and fundraising. I learned how to effectively communicate with team members, manage tight budgets, and create engaging content that resonates with the community.</p>
									
									<p> One of the highlights of my time with Aalborg Pride was being given the opportunity to take charge of a significant aspect of the event with the Afterparty.
									
									The COVID-19 pandemic brought many challenges to our organization, and we had to cancel the pride celebrations in both 2020 and 2021. However, our team remained dedicated and continued to work on planning for future events. I am proud of the resilience and adaptability shown by our team during these difficult times.
									
									<p>Overall, my experience with Aalborg Pride has been an unforgettable journey. It has taught me valuable skills that I will carry with me throughout my personal and professional life. I am grateful for the opportunity to have made a positive impact in the lives of others through this organization."</p> 
									
								<p> I am currently involved with Queer Nord, an organization dedicated to promoting diversity, inclusion, and equal rights for the LGBTQIA+ community in the north of Denmark. Since joining the organization in January 2023, I have been actively engaged in a variety of initiatives and activities.</p>

									<p> One of the projects I am particularly excited about is a photography project that I am spearheading. The project aims to celebrate the diversity and strength of the queer community through a series of powerful images. I am currently in the process of developing the project and gathering resources to bring it to fruition. </p>
									
									<p> Being involved with Queer Nord has been a fulfilling and enriching experience. It has allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for promoting equal rights and social justice. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this inspiring organization and look forward to making a positive impact in the lives of others through my involvement.</p>

									<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14B8MIynEdtFQwuWL1DB-0_AwBvh9vdET/view?usp=share_link">Tiderne skifter</a></h3>
									<p>I was the production leader for a production called "Tiderne Skifter," which was my longest and most professional project to date. From the conception of the idea to the premiere at our school, I played a critical role in every stage of the production process. As the production leader, I was responsible for planning the entire production process, and ensuring the final product met our high standards of quality. </p>

									<h3><a href="Pride SoMe.html">SoMe Creator at Aalborg Pride</a></h3>
									<p>From 2020 to 2022, I was responsible for Aalborg Pride's social media presence, particularly on Instagram. I developed and executed a content strategy that centered partly around interviews with queer individuals. The theme of these interviews was "We are not alone," which aimed to highlight the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals living in smaller cities, where it can often feel isolating.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Aalborg Pride Afterparty</a></h3>
									<p>In 2022, I successfully planned and executed the official Afterparty at Aalborg Pride. This involved a series of meetings with the venue and volunteers, briefing everybody and making sure our expectations aligned. The event was attended by 500 guests, and I received only positive feedback, indicating that it was a successful first-time event. </p>
