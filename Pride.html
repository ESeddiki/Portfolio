								<p> Over my nearly two-year journey with Aalborg Pride, I had the privilege of being actively involved in the planning and execution of various aspects of the event. Sadly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we faced the challenging decision of canceling the pride celebrations in both 2020 and 2021. Nevertheless, I remained deeply committed to contributing to the event's success and was engaged in the planning processes for these years.</p>
								<p>Then, in 2022, I had a pivotal role as the leader in the planning and execution of the official Afterparty for Aalborg Pride. My responsibilities included orchestrating a series of meticulous meetings with the venue and dedicated volunteers, where I effectively communicated our vision and ensured the seamless coordination of every element. This event witnessed a remarkable attendance of over 400 guests, a significant achievement given the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. The overwhelmingly positive feedback we received underscored the undeniable success of the Afterparty. </p>
									<p>Just five days before the scheduled date for the pride celebrations, I found myself in the extraordinary position of assuming the lead role in the project. This was an intense and stressful undertaking, but I managed to execute the event as smoothly as possible, adding another layer of accomplishment to my journey with Aalborg Pride.</p>
									<p>The night of the event was truly remarkable, with the audience thoroughly enjoying the mesmerizing performances by the drag queens and DJs. Witnessing the joy and positivity radiating from every corner of the event was a source of immense pride and gratification. This experience allowed me to leverage my skills and dedication to contribute positively to the LGBTQIA+ community, and it was a rewarding chapter in my involvement with Aalborg Pride.</p>

									<p> (Screenshot of a few the interviews from @aalborgpride on Instagram (2021))</p>
									<p> For a span of two years, I held the position of Social Media Manager at Aalborg Pride. During this tenure, I was deeply committed to crafting engaging content that served a dual purpose: to raise awareness of the event itself and to shed light on the pressing issues confronting the LGBTQIA+ community. A paramount objective was to underscore the vast diversity within the community and emphasize the inherent humanity and rights of queer individuals.</p>
<p>One notable accomplishment was the substantial growth of our social media presence. Over this period, I successfully doubled our following, a remarkable 100% increase, a testament to the effectiveness of the content and the power of our mission. </p>
										
									<p>My role went beyond conventional social media management, as I leveraged my skills in media production to create in-depth portrait interviews with ten remarkable queer individuals. These interviews were thoughtfully designed to offer an intimate view into their lives and unique experiences. They provided an invaluable platform for these individuals to share their personal stories and perspectives.</p>
										
									<p>My overarching goal was to foster a heightened understanding and appreciation for the LGBTQIA+ community and the intricate challenges it faces. The purpose was to utilize social media as a formidable tool for social change and advocacy, focusing on the cultivation of empathy, deeper understanding, and greater acceptance for the LGBTQIA+ community.</p>
									<p>This experience was profoundly rewarding, as it allowed me to channel my media expertise and passion into effecting positive societal change and advancing the cause of social justice.</p>
